# Legal institutions and oppressive violence

## Notes

[] Ingest comparative constitutions 
[x] Add GTD events
[x] Add ACED civil war
[x] Add EPR 
[] Update/rename models: analyses for democracy, LJI, legal system, CCP
[] Add full control models with some combination of: regime, wealth, conflict, 
   population, ethnic stuff; see whether base2 needs to be revised
   [] base model 3 convergence issues
[ ] Finish LJI (democracy or controls + LJI?) and legal sys model updates
[x] Re-run xgboost with new variable set: only v2x_polyarchy (and libdem?); keep 
   GDP, per capita, pop, rents
[x] Figure 3: scatterplot matrix; show best fit lines instead, or some other way
   to make it less cluttered

Less certain tasks:

[x] xgboost on random intercepts model residuals
[] Add data for press freedom?
[] Check why democracy in bivariate has no relationship but in models does 
   (random intercepts); RIs are correlated with democracy and wealth.
[] Fix ITT aggregation (dissident no multi-events)
