# Democratic Electoral Systems data

Each row in the data is a legislative or executive election. When converting to yearly data, this leaves gaps in non-election years. The data are supplemented by the Cheibub, Gandhi, and Vreeland Democracy-Dictatorship Index, which is copied in the "data" folder.
